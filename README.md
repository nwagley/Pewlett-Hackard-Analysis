# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

### Purpose 
The purpose of this assignment was to find out the so called " Silver Tsunami" from the company database. The term is used for retiring people.
We will be looking at the data from the company "Pewlett-Hackard", the companies manager has given us the task to figure out the number of total
retiring employees and to identify those retiring in a mentorship program.  

### Results 
after looking at the data we came up with the following conclusions

We can see the number of employees who are about to retire based on their most recent title. From the above list we can see that there are approx, 30 
thousand senior engineers, 29 thousand all senior staff 15 thousand engineers, 12 thousand regular staff, 5 thousand Leads , almost 2 thousand assistant 
and 2 managers. 

### Summary 
When we look at the task given by Bobby and the data provided by the company itself, we can see that there is a lot of people retiring at the same time 
hence called the " silver tsunami " looking at the above table we can add the number roles and find out how many roles there needs to be filled. There will be 
78,155 in total openings in the company. This will not happen all at once but will be streached along the timeline and the dates and years. 

The company has alot of seniors retiring at the sametime. Mentoring the next generation and showing them the ways of the comapany will be a challenge for Pewlett-
Hackawrd as we see the ratio of the leads to the staff almost double in the retirement numbers. There will be however enough assistant mangagers and less managers 
retirement means they will have time to mentor them.
